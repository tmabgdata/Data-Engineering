# Data Engineering Repository

Welcome to the Data Engineering repository! This repository showcases a diverse collection of data engineering projects, highlighting my skills and expertise in designing, implementing, and optimizing data pipelines, storage solutions, and analysis workflows. Each project demonstrates the use of industry-standard tools and best practices to process, transform, and analyze data efficiently.

## Featured Projects

Below is an overview of the key projects in this repository:

### [Azure Data Pipeline with SQL Server, Data Factory, Data Storage Lake, Databricks, Synapse Analytics and Power BI ](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/Azure_Data_Pipeline_PowerBI)

- Produce a detailed visual and dynamic report with a business analysis made from the data with focus on exploring the database and identifying patterns, opportunities, possibility of creating products and solutions.

### [Data Pipeline with Airflow, Azure Databricks, and Slack Integration](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/Airflow_Azure_Databricks_Pipeline)

- This project implements a data pipeline to extract, transform, and report currency exchange rates using Airflow, Azure Databricks, and Slack. The pipeline performs the following key steps:

1. **Extraction**: Fetches daily currency exchange rates from a public API.
2. **Transformation**: Converts rates into different formats, performs aggregations, and additional calculations.
3. **Reporting**: Sends transformed data and generated graphs to a Slack channel.

### [Azure Data Lake Pipeline](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/Azure_Data_Lake_Pipeline)

- This project highlights the creation of data pipelines using Azure Data Lake, focusing on efficient data ingestion, storage, and transformation. It includes real-world examples of managing large-scale data workflows on the Azure platform.

### [Azure Databricks and Data Factory](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/Azure_Databricks_DataFactory)

- This project integrates Azure Databricks and Data Factory to create robust data processing pipelines. It demonstrates the orchestration of big data workflows and advanced analytics using these powerful Azure tools.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to individual project folders for detailed documentation, source code, and step-by-step guides.
2. Follow the instructions in each project's README to set up and execute the pipelines and workflows.
3. Explore the scripts and workflows to learn best practices and replicate similar solutions in your own environment.
