# Data Engineering Repository

Welcome to the Data Engineering repository! This repository hosts a collection of data engineering projects and analyses that demonstrate my skills and expertise in the field of data engineering. Each project showcases various data engineering techniques and tools used to process, transform, and analyze data.

## About the Projects

Here are some of the featured projects within this repository:

### [DataEngineeringAWS](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/DataEngineeringAWS)

This project dives into data engineering on AWS, exploring the setup and implementation of data pipelines, storage solutions, and data processing using cloud-based services.

### [Formação Engenheiro de Dados AWS](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/Forma%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Engenheiro%20de%20Dados%20AWS)

The "Formação Engenheiro de Dados AWS" project offers comprehensive insights into data engineering concepts and practices within the AWS ecosystem, including hands-on exercises and real-world examples.

### [Python, S3, and Redshift](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/Python_S3_Redshift)

This project showcases the integration of Python, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, providing a practical demonstration of data engineering techniques.

### [Python, MongoDB](https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Engineering/tree/master/Python_%26_MongoDB)

This integration project between python and mongodb is just a practice to perform basic queries and manipulations in NoSQL databases

## How to Use

1. Explore the individual project folders to find detailed information and code for each data engineering project.
2. Each project folder contains relevant files, scripts, and documentation explaining the data engineering processes used.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the project READMEs to set up and execute the data engineering pipelines and analyses.
